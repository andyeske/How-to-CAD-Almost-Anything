# How to CAD Almost Anything: MIT IAP 2024
Welcome to How to CAD Almost Anything! In this repository, you'll find the workshop's slides, recordings and Solidworks files.

## Workshop Summary

Ever wondered how are objects from our daily lives designed? How can we generate a computer 3D model of a mug, a bottle of Diet Coke, or a Saturn V rocket? What about designing the blades of a jet-engine? A test dummy? How about making an animation of a LEGO house building itself? Or making a realistic render of a bowl of fruit? In this MIT AeroAstro workshop, you will learn the skills to design all of these, and much more! 

Split into 9 2-hour long sessions, the first half of each session will be spent learning new Solidworks skills, while the second half will see the application of these news skills through in-class activities, with a focus on reverse engineering. In contrast to traditional mechanical design courses, this workshop places greater emphasis on the design process itself, understanding how we can plan and best leverage our available tools to arrive to our desired result. Thus, the sessions are less about following the instructions on an engineering drawing, but about independent thinking and strategizing, reverse engineering an object into a 3D model. 

Through the workshop’s 9 sessions, the goal is for the student to:
* Have learned all the essential Solidworks skills, enough to be able to pass the industry-standard Mechanical Design [CSWA](https://www.solidworks.com/certifications/mechanical-design-cswa-mechanical-design) exam.
* Have built a comprehensive design portfolio, in the form of a presentation (see Workshop Portfolio (optional) section below), to showcase all the different in-class projects and Solidworks skills mastered.
* Feel that it can take any object and exclaim, “I know how to CAD this!”.

### Session 8: It's not engineering without drawings!
(Wednesday, January 31)

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll exploit one of Solidworks’ built-in best features, its drawing-creation workspace. In essence, after creating a part or assembly model, it is possible to create an engineering drawing of it.
Session 8’s goals include:
*	Learning how to create an engineering drawing of a part and assembly (including exploded views).
*	Exploring the best-practices of drawing creation, including different formats and information to be conveyed (such as tolerancing, material properties).

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 8, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
*	A [wooden manikin](https://images.ctfassets.net/f1fikihmjtrp/4dvHxgg2TXI8tXXi1n8pPa/052b23016c0607120f609b0329e2ed1d/21651-1002-2-4ww.jpg), in the form of a test dummy (each individual part put into an assembly). 
*	A set of engineering drawings of the manikin’s assembly and each of its constituent parts.

**To do (optional):** Add 2-X slides to the portfolio, one for each designed item, with pictures and a short description of the Solidworks skills employed to during the design process.

### Session 9: It's not mechanical design without gears! 
(Friday, January 9)

**Objective:** In this final session, we’ll dive into one common machine part often synonymous with mechanical design, gears! Many objects from our daily lives are equipped with gears, so it is important to understand what role they play and how to use them effectively. Session 9’s goals include: 
*	Understanding the theory behind [gears and their sizing/ratios](https://auto.howstuffworks.com/gears.htm).
*	Learning how to design gears in Solidworks and establishing mechanical mates between them.
*	Making an animation providing a motor torque.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 9, we’ll design a variety of items, including:

## Workshop Portfolio (Optional)

“How to CAD almost anything!” is a purely project-based workshop, with most, if not all the projects taking place as session activities. As a result, the workshop does not have any form of “homework”, other than additional work that the student is willing to put to expand on the in-class activities. However, as mentioned above, one of the purposes of this workshop is for the student to build a portfolio of projects, one which can be used to showcase its 3D-modeling skills. Hence, as an optional workshop activity, the student will be able to create a portfolio presentation, consisting of the slides made during/after each session. Although this is an ungraded activity, the student is encouraged to be creative and use this as an opportunity to showcase its learnings! Feel free to include screenshots from the Solidworks workspace, rendered images, animations, engineering drawings or anything deemed appropriate. Additionally, including one last slide with thoughts about the workshop and recommendations to make it even better next time would be greatly appreciated!
